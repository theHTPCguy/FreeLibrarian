FreeLibrarian
=============

Free Librarian organizes and completes your ebook collection from usenet, similar to the way Sickbeard does for TV,
and CouchPotato does for Movies.

You must have an account on at least one indexer, and you must have an nzb download program installed
(such as sabnzbd+) and configured to use your provider account for downloading.

Free Librarian does not download anything. It's an organizer for your ebook collections, using book sources to
ensure that your collections are as complete as possible.
